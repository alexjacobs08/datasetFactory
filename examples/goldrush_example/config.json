The tone should be personal, often reflective, hopeful, sometimes desperate or weary, using period-appropriate language. Content should describe daily life, arduous labor, weather, food scarcity, health issues, loneliness, gold finds (or lack thereof), social interactions, requests for supplies/news, and expressions of hopes/fears.

Examples: A letter detailing a harsh winter, a prospector boasting of a small find, a letter expressing loneliness and asking for news from home."
